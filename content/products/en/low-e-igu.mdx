# Low-E Insulated Glass Unit

Our premium Low-E IGU combines advanced coating technology with precision manufacturing to deliver exceptional thermal performance for Australian buildings.

## Performance Advantages

### Thermal Insulation
The Low-E (low emissivity) coating on surface #2 reflects long-wave heat radiation back into the room during winter, while the argon gas fill reduces convective heat transfer.

### Solar Control
Our solar control Low-E option rejects up to 75% of solar heat gain, keeping interiors cool in summer without compromising natural light.

### Condensation Resistance
The warm edge spacer system maintains warmer glass edge temperatures, reducing the risk of condensation on cold mornings.

## Technical Specifications

### Construction
```
Glass 1 (Outer): 6mm Clear Float
Spacer: 12mm Warm Edge Aluminum
Gas Fill: 90% Argon / 10% Air
Glass 2 (Inner): 6mm Low-E Coated
```
