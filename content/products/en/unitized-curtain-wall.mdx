# Unitized Curtain Wall System

Our unitized curtain wall system represents the pinnacle of modern facade technology. Each panel is completely pre-assembled in our factory, including glass, gaskets, and hardware, before being shipped to site for rapid installation.

## Key Advantages

### Factory Quality Control
- 100% factory assembly eliminates on-site variables
- Every unit tested for air, water, and structural performance
- Consistent quality across thousands of panels

### Rapid Installation
- Install up to 15 units per day per crew
- Minimal scaffolding requirements
- Weather-independent installation possible

### Superior Performance
- Four-sided structural silicone glazing option
- Pressure-equalized drainage system
- Thermal break profiles for energy efficiency

## Technical Specifications

### Structural Performance
Our system is engineered to withstand Australian wind conditions, with independent testing to AS 4284 confirming performance under cyclonic loads.

### Thermal Performance
The thermally broken aluminum profiles combined with high-performance IGU achieve U-values as low as 1.5 W/m²K, meeting stringent Section J requirements.

## Applications

- Commercial office towers
- Hotels and hospitality
- Mixed-use developments
- Healthcare facilities
- Educational institutions

## Customization Options

- Multiple profile finishes (anodized, powder coated, PVDF)
- Various glass types (Low-E, tinted, reflective)
- Integrated opening vents
- Spandrel panels and cladding integration
